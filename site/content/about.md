Prior to joining the Bar, Adrienne was a solicitor and then partner at the boutique claimant environmental firm, Richard Buxton Environmental & Public Law. Her practice focussed on public law challenges in the environmental field, such as grants of planning permission and claims in noise and odour nuisance. 

Before studying law at Wolfson College, Cambridge, Adrienne worked in Indian Kashmir on a humanitarian mission with the International Committee of the Red Cross. Having moved to the UK, she then represented asylum seekers and refugees before the Asylum & Immigration Tribunal as a caseworker with the Refugee Legal Centre.
